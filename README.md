#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative and Summative Assessments

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 Students will define the torque, purpose of weighing in torque measurements and able to connect the circuit and explain the basic concepts. With this student can understand the theoretical concepts and its purpose. After understanding the theoretical concepts students will take pretest (self-evaluation) questions to assess their understanding on relevant experiment (Formative assessment). Now, they will connect the torque sensors as per the circuit diagram and select the arm length having 0.5 and 1 meter. Now students will select the weighing ranging from 0.1 to 1 kg then load into the arm and note down the indicated reading from torque sensor. Also, students will calculate the torque manually using the length of arm and weighing load. These values will be put into the formula and error % shall be calculated. After performing the experiment, student shall answer to the post test questions (Summative assessment).
